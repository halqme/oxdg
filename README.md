A fast, lightweight dependency graph CLI for modern JavaScript and TypeScript, built on [Oxc](https://oxc.rs/).

**oxdg = Oxc Dependency Graph**

oxdg uses `oxc-parser` and `oxc-resolver` for parsing and module resolution, then adds a small graph layer for dependency analysis, queries, and rendering.

No initialization. No required config file. No system Graphviz dependency.

Try it:

```bash
npx oxdg src
npx oxdg src --circular
npx oxdg src --image graph.svg
```

![bunx oxdg --cwd src index.ts -i graph.svg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/halqme/oxdg/refs/heads/main/graph.svg)

## Features

- JavaScript and TypeScript
- Vue single-file components, extracting imports from `<script>` and `<script setup>` blocks written in JS, TS, JSX, or TSX
- ESM and CommonJS
- Static imports, dynamic imports, `require()`, `require.resolve()`, and re-exports
- Type-only imports and TypeScript path aliases
- Circular dependency detection with CI-friendly failure codes
- Orphan, leaf, and direct-dependent queries
- Text, JSON, Mermaid, D2, and standalone SVG output
- Zero-config one-shot CLI
- No Graphviz or other system package required for SVG generation

## Performance

The stable benchmark measures the latest published npm release of oxdg against pinned versions of other dependency-graph tools on fixed [Hono](https://github.com/honojs/hono) and [Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) revisions.

The full report records runtime statistics, release-to-main changes, exact commands, package footprint, dependency locks, and runner metadata.

## Package footprint

Package footprint is measured separately from runtime performance on every CI pull request and release validation. The shared check reports packed and unpacked package sizes plus `node_modules` size after a clean install in the GitHub Actions Summary. It also enforces the existing **500 KiB unpacked-package limit**.

## How it compares

oxdg is inspired by [Madge](https://github.com/pahen/madge), but is built around the modern Oxc parser and resolver and includes Mermaid, D2, and standalone SVG output.

`dependency-cruiser` provides a substantially broader architecture-validation and rule system than oxdg. oxdg instead focuses on dependency graph analysis as a small, one-shot CLI.

`module-graph` refers to `@thepassle/module-graph`; its documented analyzer is ESM-oriented and does not analyze `require()`.

## One-shot CLI

Analyze a file or directory:

```bash
bunx oxdg ./src
```

Generate a standalone SVG:

```bash
bunx oxdg ./src/index.ts --image graph.svg
```

The resulting SVG is ready to open in a browser or share directly. No Graphviz installation is required.

Find circular dependencies:

```bash
bunx oxdg ./src --circular
bunx oxdg ./src --fail-on-circular
```

`--fail-on-circular` exits with code 1 when a cycle exists. Successful analysis exits with 0; invalid command usage exits with 2.

Example:

```text
src/a.ts -> src/b.ts -> src/a.ts
```

Query the graph:

```bash
bunx oxdg ./src --orphans
bunx oxdg ./src --leaves
bunx oxdg ./src --depends src/core.ts
bunx oxdg ./src --json --orphans
```

Adding `--json` to a query prints the matching module IDs as a JSON array.

Use structured or graph-oriented output:

```bash
bunx oxdg ./src --json
bunx oxdg ./src --mermaid --rankdir TB
bunx oxdg ./src --d2
bunx oxdg ./src --image graph.svg --rankdir TB
```

The same commands work with `npx`:

```bash
npx oxdg ./src
npx oxdg ./src/index.ts --image graph.svg
```

Without an output option, oxdg prints a plain-text dependency graph.

Additional analysis options include `--cwd`, `--tsconfig` (or `--ts-config`), `--include-npm`, `--no-type-imports`, `--extensions ts,tsx`, and repeated `--exclude` patterns.

Exclude strings use gitignore semantics via the `ignore` package, relative to `cwd` (the current directory by default), for both input files and imported modules. For example, `*.test.ts` matches at any depth, `/generated.ts` matches only at the root, `src/generated.ts` matches that path from the root, and `generated/` excludes directories of that name and their contents. Patterns are evaluated in order; `!` re-includes matching paths, but a file cannot be re-included while its parent directory is excluded. Comments (`#`) and backslash escapes follow gitignore syntax. `.gitignore` files are not loaded automatically, and gitignore patterns do not apply to modules outside `cwd`.

```bash
oxdg ./src --exclude '*.test.ts' --exclude '!src/keep.test.ts'
oxdg ./src --exclude 'generated/' --exclude '/src/legacy.ts'
```

Short aliases include `-c`, `-j`, `-i`, and `-d`. `--rankdir` accepts `LR`, `RL`, `TB`, or `BT` for Mermaid and SVG output and is rejected for other output modes.

Warnings are written to stderr, so structured output on stdout remains usable by scripts and coding agents.

## Design

oxdg deliberately leaves parsing and module resolution to Oxc.

```text
source files
    ↓
oxc-parser
    ↓
dependency extraction
    ↓
oxc-resolver
    ↓
ModuleGraph
    ├── queries
    ├── cycle detection
    ├── text
    ├── JSON
    ├── Mermaid
    ├── D2
    └── SVG
```

This keeps oxdg focused on the dependency-graph layer rather than maintaining its own JavaScript parser or module resolver.

## Installation

For repeated use in a project:

```bash
npm install --save-dev oxdg
```

or:

```bash
bun add --dev oxdg
```

The published CLI requires Node.js 22 or newer.

## API

The public API is a small functional layer over the same `ModuleGraph` used by the CLI:

```ts
import { analyze, findCycles, renderSvg } from "oxdg";

const { graph, warnings } = await analyze("./src");

const cycles = findCycles(graph);
const svg = renderSvg(graph);
```

The API also exposes graph queries and text, JSON, Mermaid, and D2 renderers.

Module IDs are normalized paths relative to the analysis root.

## Development

```bash
bun install
bun run check
bun run lint
bun run format:check
bun test
bun run build
bun run release:check
```

`check` runs TypeScript type checking.

`build` uses Vite+'s `vp pack` command, powered by tsdown, to produce the ESM distribution, declarations, and source maps.

`release:check` packs the package, validates the published contents, installs the packed artifact into a temporary project, and exercises the packaged CLI including version, circular dependency, JSON, and SVG checks.
